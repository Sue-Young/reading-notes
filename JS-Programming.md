## What is Control Flow?

> Control flow is the order in which statements are executed by the computer

The computer excutes the line in a file in order.  Unless the code changes the control flow with conditionals, loops and functions.

A ```while``` statement looks like this:

```javascript
while (x < 10) {
  x++;
}
```

## Functions

Functions allow you to execute lines of code over and over again. It is a set of statements that perform a particular task(s). Most often, it takes input and returns output.

```javascript
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myFunction(4, 3);
</script>
```

## Operators

<a name="abcd"></a>

In JavaScript, an operator is a symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).
