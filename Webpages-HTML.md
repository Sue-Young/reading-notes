# Building Structured Webpages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

### What is Wireframe?

Wireframing is used to plan the information hierarchy of our website, app, or product. This process focuses on how we want the user to process information on a site.

We use plain black and white diagrams.

Wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.
