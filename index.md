### What is Markdown?

Markdown is actually a simple Markup syntax. Confusing, right? Why John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, the creators of Markdown, couldn’t have named it MarkupLite is confusing to me. 

Regardless of the misnomer, Markdown serves an important role in the Markup world. It is a text Markup that is designed for readability. Unlike HTML, Markdown has no tags. You can read and write Markdown with simple plain text annotations. This is useful in technical documentation and has been adopted by open source heavy hitters like Git/GitHub. 	

GitHub has a wonderful [Markdown Syntax Guide]{https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links}. 

But for just a taste of what Markdown looks like, take a gander at this sample. 

```markdown

Styling Text
**Bold**  
_Italic_  
***Bold and italic***


Headers 1-6 are designated with 1-6 hash signs
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Lists
- Unordered list element 1
- Unordered list element 2

1. Ordered list element 1
2. Ordered list element 2

Links and Images (The fun stuff!)
[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```


One last note, Markdown is converted into HTML by a pre-processor before being rendered. So all those lovely tags are still there, they are just created for you. 










## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sue-Young/reading-notes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sue-Young/reading-notes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
