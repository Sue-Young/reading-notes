## Choosing a Text Editor

There are lots of different text editors out there. The most important thing is find the right one for you. If it increases your productivity, then great!

You are trying to find an editor that helpsyou write code fast with less bugs. At the very least it is good to have:

1. Code Completion (don't forget Emmet)
2. Syntax Highlighing
3. Themes that Reduce Eye-Strain
4. Adding Extentions


## The Command Line 
The CLI is a text based interface to your operating system. You can have many terminals open performing different tasks. Bash is a common shell and the one we will be using in this course. Bash is rich with commands. The most important command you need to know is "man". This will keep you busy for a few decades,[Linux Manual Pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/dir_section_1.html). You're welcome!

There are lots of Linux CLI cheat sheets out there. I like ones with examples like this one [Linux Cheat Sheet With Examples](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-commands-cheat-sheet#file-commands).

### Directory Navigation

This cheat sheet jumps right to the [Directory Navigation Commands](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-commands-cheat-sheet#directory-navigation).
