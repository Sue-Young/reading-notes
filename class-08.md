Better ways to do layout with CSS Flexbox.

## Flexbox

One dimentional content means you are layout items in one dimension (row or column with or without wrap).

The main axis the line along with the content with be rendered: horizontal or vertical set by the `flex-direction`. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis.  So if the `flex-direction` is `row` then the cross axis is column.

Because flexbox only changes the view but not the underlying model, this impacts accessibility. Screen readers will speak the model.

### Why Flexbox?

These design are hard to do with `float` and positioning:

1. centering code vertically in its parent
2. having children take up same space
3. having all columns in a layout take up the same height even with different content
