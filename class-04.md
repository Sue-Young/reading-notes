# Class 04 Reading Notes

This content is important because we are learning about HTML links, JavaScript Functions and CSS Layout. 

## HTML Links

We use the anchor tag to create hyperlinks `<a>`. The `href` attribute is the target that contain the web address information.

```HTML
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
```

From <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks>

>A link title is only revealed on mouse hover, which means that people relying on keyboard controls or touchscreens to navigate web pages will have difficulty accessing title information. If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, for example by putting it in the regular text.

## CCS Layout

Normal flow is the way pages lay theselves out if one has not changed their layout specificially. 

1. Clearer code and therefore easier to maintain
2. Help your site be accessible
3. Improve SEO

### Uses for `<sup>` and `<sub>` Elements

```JavaScript
let myVariable = 'Code Fellows';
```
